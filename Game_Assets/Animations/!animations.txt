Pygame does not support gifs.

If you want to use animations you need to get each frame of the animation by downloading the gif and uploading it to Piskell as an image.

That will auto-split the gif into each of its frames.

Then you need to loop through all the images for the animation.

Obviously, it isn't easy or quick, only use animations if you are confident that you will have enough time!
